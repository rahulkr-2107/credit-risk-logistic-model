# Credit Risk Scoring Model (Logistic Regression)

## Objective

Predict the likelihood of loan default using historical loan application data and logistic regression. This project simulates how risk analysts build simple credit scoring systems in Python.

---

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from an open Kaggle loan dataset. It includes the following relevant features:

- **Dependents**: Number of dependents
- **ApplicantIncome**: Monthly income of the applicant
- **LoanAmount**: Amount of loan applied for
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Duration of loan in **months**, converted to years
- **Credit_History**: Whether applicant has good credit history (1/0)
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable (1 = default, 0 = repaid)

---

## Methods Used

- Cleaned and transformed raw categorical values
- Converted loan term to a normalized time unit (years)
- Built a logistic regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated model with:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
  - ROC-AUC score
  - ROC Curve plot

---

## Sample Results

- **ROC-AUC Score**: ~0.72 (may vary by dataset split)
- **Plot**: ROC Curve stored as `roc_curve.png`
